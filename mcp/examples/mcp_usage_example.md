### Workflow Automation

MCP can automate various tasks:

- **Automatic commits** after completing features
- **Issue creation** for bugs found
- **Status updates** of issues
- **Progress reports** generation

## T-Watch Specific Examples

### LVGL â†’ LovyanGFX Migration

```
Create an issue for the complete LVGL to LovyanGFX migration with:
